# 1# 1.	Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

# import math
# num = input("Enter the value of D: ").split(",") #taken a input with the comma separation.
# res = []    # created a empty list

# for D in num:
#     Q = round(math.sqrt(2 * 50 * int(D) / 30),2)  #I have stopped the decimal with two values.
#     res.append(Q)

# print(res)


# 2.Define a class named Shape and its subclass ...........................................................
# Square. The Square class has an init function 
# which takes a length as argument. Both classes 
# have an area function which can print the area 
# of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.

# length=int(input("Enter the number: "))
# class Shape:
#     area=0

# class Square(Shape):
#     def __init__(self, length):
#         # Shape.__init__(self)
#         self.length = length

#     def area(self):
#         return self.length*self.length

# s= Square(length)
# print (s.area())


# 3.Create a class to find the three elements that sum.........................................
#  to zero from a set of n real numbers.
# Input array: [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
# Output: [[-10,2,8],[-7,-3,10]]


# class py_solution:
#  def threeSum(self, nums):
#         nums, result, i = sorted(nums), [], 0
#         while i < len(nums) - 2:
#             j, k = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
#             while j < k:
#                 if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < 0:
#                     j += 1
#                 elif nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] > 0:
#                     k -= 1
#                 else:
#                     result.append([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]])
#                     j, k = j + 1, k - 1
#                     while j < k and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]:
#                         j += 1
#                     while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k + 1]:
#                         k -= 1
#             i += 1
#             while i < len(nums) - 2 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
#                 i += 1
#         return result

# print(py_solution().threeSum([-25, -10, -7, -3, 2, 4, 8, 10]))



# 4. What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well...........................................

# class Test:  
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.x = 0
# class Derived_Test(Test):
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.y = 1
# def main():
#     b = Derived_Test()
#     print(b.x,b.y)
# main()

# Answer----It will give error because class B inherits A 
# but variable x isnt inherited.
 


# class A:
#     def __init__(self, x= 1):
#         self.x = x
# class der(A):
#     def __init__(self,y = 2):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.y = y
# def main():
#     obj = der()
#     print(obj.x, obj.y)
# main()

# Answer--as the invoking methods are properly implemented
# x=1 and y=2



 
# class A:
#     def __init__(self,x):
#         self.x = x
#     def count(self,x):
#         self.x = self.x+1

# class B(A):
#     def __init__(self, y=0):
#         A.__init__(self, 3)
#         self.y = y
#     def count(self):
#         self.y += 1     

# def main():
#     obj = B()
#     obj.count()
#     print(obj.x, obj.y)
# main()

 # Answer--as the invoking methods are properly implemented
# x=3 and y=1

 

# class A:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.multiply(15)
#         print(self.i)

#     def multiply(self, i):
#         self.i = 4 * i

# class B(A):
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__()

#     def multiply(self, i):
#         self.i = 2 * i
# obj = B()
 
#  answer-- 30 ....the derived class B overrides base class A.





# 5.	Create a Time class and initialize it with ..........................................................
# hours and minutes.
# Make a method addTime which should take two time 
# object and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
# Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
# Make a method DisplayMinute which should display 
# the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.


# class  Time(object):

#     def __init__(self, hours, minutes):
#         self.hours = hours
#         self.minutes = minutes

#     def addTime(t1, t2):
#         t3 = Time(0, 0) # creating new object
#         t3.hours = t1.hours + t2.hours # sum of hours
#         t3.minutes = t1.minutes + t2.minutes # sum of minutes
#         while t3.minutes >= 60:
#             t3.hours += 1
#             t3.minutes -= 60
#         return t3

#     def displayTime(self):
#         print("Time is %d hours and %d minutes" %(self.hours, self.minutes))

#     def displayMinutes(self):
#         print((self.hours * 60) + self.minutes, "minutes")

# a = Time(2, 90)
# b = Time(1, 90)
# c = Time.addTime(a,b)

# c.displayTime()
# c.displayMinutes()

# input()


    
# 6.           Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor ..................................
# that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after 
# confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed 
# as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0..
#  In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld()  should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..	
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16
# 18
# Sample Output:
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.
# You are young.
# You are a teenager.
# You are a teenager.
# You are old.
# You are old.
# You are old.
